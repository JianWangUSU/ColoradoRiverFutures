# Colorado River Futures - Code Projects

Small and bigger coding efforts in support of the Colorado River Futures project (https://qcnr.usu.edu/coloradoriver/futures)

All coding efforts in R Studio.

Most of these efforts are beginning coding efforts and works in progress.

## Explanation of Contents

1. **EvapCalcs** - plots to show reservoir evaporation for Lakes Mead and Powell as a function of reservoir storage/level. This supports
an alternative management paradigm where reservoir evaporation is counted as part of lower basin users consumptive use.
1. **InterimShortageGuidelines** - plots of cutbacks in deliveries as a function of Lake Mead level. Both for the Interim Guidelines and newly released Drought Contingency Plan.
1. **MeadPowellPlots** - visualization of the Lake Powell-Lake Mead Equalization rules. This is Powell annual release as a function of Powell storage and Mead storage. Also includes plots that show the reservoir zones.
1. **Runge_MCDM_Analysis** - interactive parallel coordinate plot visualization of the 18 objectives use in the analysis by Runge et al of Glend Canyon Dam management alternatives. Runge, M. C., LaGory, K. E., Russell, K., Balsom, J. R., Butler, R. A., Coggins, J. L. G., Grantz, K. A., Hayse, J., Hlohowskyj, I., Korman, J., May, J. E., O'Rourke, D. J., Poch, L. A., Prairie, J. R., VanKuiken, J. C., Van Lonkhuyzen, R. A., Varyu, D. R., Verhaaren, B. T., Veselka, T. D., Williams, N. T., Wuthrich, K. K., Yackulic, C. B., Billerbeck, R. P., and Knowles, G. W. (2015). "Decision analysis to support development of the Glen Canyon Dam long-term experimental and management plan." 2015-5176, U.S. Geological Survey, Reston, VA. http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/sir20155176.
1. **TimeToDeadPool** - a steady deterministic analysis of the number of years to hit Lake Mead (or Lake Powell) dead pool (or other target elevation) given a starting storage volume, steady inflow, and steady demand. Used to explore alternative management policies where reservoir release is a function of reservoir storage and inflow.

To run any code, download and install R and RStudio. Within the subfolder, open the .R file, highlight all the code, and run.
